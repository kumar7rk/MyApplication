# MyApplication
This is a basic app which shows the current value of photometer sensor in a text view and in another it shows the maximum value recorded up until now. This app would be finally expanded into H-BITS which would be more robust in displaying the same information.
This logic was used in Bed&amp;&amp;Dark scenario for A-SUM;This repository is the core of the H-BITS.
